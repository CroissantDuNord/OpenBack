# OpenBack
Open source server-side re-implemention of the [Minecraft Backrooms Server by TeamByte](https://www.thebackrooms.gg/) in the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) Language

# How to contribute

## Devploper
If you know Skript, you can contribute to the code, check the progress list and add what you like!
*If you have question, ask them in DM, or in the #open-back channel on team byte discord*

## Source
If you have **Recording / Video / Screen / Wiki...** any source with information on the server, Share them it helps a lot, We need
- Information / Video on Boss
- Item Lore / Description
- Any other form of information on the server

## Texture Pack
I need help to fix the texture pack, It's currently broken and won't load texture at all (Only weapons work), If you are able to fix it this would help a **LOT!**
All files and information are in the folder named "doc" you have documention on the pack, and the pack itself

# Contact
Concact me at mine333_ on discord, or in the #open-back channel on [team-byte discord server](https://discord.gg/AKxATpNa)

**NOTE**: This project is **not affilated** to *Team Byte* or *The Backrooms Minecraft Server* This is *user-content* made after the closure of the server, This project is also non-commercial

# How to Setup-Up
**THIS IS A DEVPLOMENT ENVIRONMENT, NOT PLAYABLE**

1. Install a server running Purpur 1.20.2 https://purpurmc.org/ (Java 16+ Required)
2. Install the plugins [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) + [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee)
3. You might want to install [Multiverse](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core) to switch between world *(level)*, Use /mv create level0 NORMAL -t FLAT to "create" a level
This will be an empty world but considered as a level (the code check for name not world content)
4. Copy the code from (main/src) into your script folder (plugins\Skript\scripts)

Done! Your devploment environment is ready!
